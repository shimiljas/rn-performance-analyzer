## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

Check your versions:
```bash
node --version  # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
npm --version   # Should be v9.0.0 or higher
```

## 🛠️ Local Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/rn-performance-analyzer.git
cd rn-performance-analyzer
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## 📦 Building for Production

### Build the application

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `out` directory.

### Preview the production build locally

You can serve the production build locally using any static file server:

```bash
npx serve out
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository Settings → Pages
   - Under "Build and deployment" → Source, select **GitHub Actions**

2. **Push to main branch:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Watch the deployment workflow complete
   - Your site will be live at: `https://[your-username].github.io/rn-performance-analyzer/`

### Deploy to other platforms

The static export works with any static hosting service:

- **Vercel**: `vercel deploy`
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `out` folder
- **AWS S3**: Upload `out` folder contents
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Connect your repository

## 📱 How to Use

### 1. Generate Performance Trace

To capture performance data from your React Native app:

**Step 1: Open React DevTools**
- Install [React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) browser extension or standalone app
- Run your React Native app in development mode: `npm start` or `yarn start`
- Open React DevTools and connect to your app

**Step 2: Record Performance Profile**
1. Navigate to the **Profiler** tab in React DevTools
2. Click the **Record** button (circle icon)
3. Interact with your app (navigate, scroll, perform actions)
4. Click **Stop** recording when done
5. Click the **Download** button (💾) to export the profiling data as JSON

**Step 3: Save the JSON file**
- The file will be downloaded as `profiling-data.json` or similar
- This contains all the performance metrics needed for analysis

### 2. Upload and Analyze

1. Open the analyzer in your browser
2. Click "Choose File" or drag & drop your JSON trace file
3. View comprehensive performance analysis:
   - Performance grade and health score
   - Critical issues and bottlenecks
   - Component-level metrics
   - Optimization recommendations

### 3. Act on Insights

Follow the prioritized recommendations to optimize your app's performance.
